# Feature: "alloc" enables support for heap allocation on "no_std" platforms, requires nightly.

# Option: "unsafe_random" enables development support for random
# number generation on no_std platforms that do not yet have
# cryptographically secure implementations.
# WARNING: Under no circumstances should this ever be enabled in
#          production builds!
